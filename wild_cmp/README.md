# Wild Compare

## Description

This project, part of the Holberton School interview preparation series, focuses on advanced string comparison using recursion.
The goal is to implement a function that compares two strings, where one of the strings can contain the special wildcard character `*`.
This character can match any string, including an empty one.

The primary challenge is to solve this problem using a purely recursive approach, without any loops `(for, while, etc.)`, adhering strictly to the Betty style guide.

## Learning Objectives

* Mastering recursive algorithms for complex problems.

* Advanced pointer arithmetic and string manipulation in C.

* Managing multiple recursive paths and states.

* Adhering to strict coding standards (Betty style).

* Problem-solving without relying on standard library functions or loops.

## Requirements

* __Language__: C

* __Compiler__: gcc 4.8.4 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

* __Style__: Betty style

* __Constraints__: No global variables, no static variables, no loops, standard library usage is forbidden.
