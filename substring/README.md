# Substring with concatenated words

## Description

This project involves implementing a C function that identifies all starting indices of substrings within a larger string. These substrings must be exact concatenations of a given list of words, where each word is used exactly once and in any order.

This is a classic string searching problem that requires careful management of pointers, memory, and state to efficiently check all possibilities. The solution employs a sliding window approach to scan the string.
