# Heap Sort Implementation

This project implements the Heap sort algorithm in C. It includes a `heap_sort` function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the sift-down approach. The `print_array` function (provided) is used to print the array after each swap operation.

**Files Included:**

* `sort.h`: Header file containing function prototypes.
* `0-heap_sort.c`: Implementation of the `heap_sort` function.
* `0-O`: File containing the Big O time complexity notations for Heap sort.
* `README.md`: This file.
